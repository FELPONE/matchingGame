# JavaScript-geometry

Richclient frontend for the Stereos system that enables displaying  3D renders, their manipulation and interaction with the editor for construction specications in the Stereos language. Client provide the following functionality: rendering 3D objects in the HTML5 webpage (by using thirdparty libraries); standard viewport manipulation (zooming, panning, rotating); listing all objects present in the construction (points, lines, polygons,solids), so that individual objects could be more easily accessed; selection of objects and groups of objects (either by using a list ofobjects, or 3D render); modifying visual characteristics of individual objects or gropus ofselected objects (point size, point color, line width, line style, line color,polygon color, polygon transparency, etc); attaching and modifying textlabels to objects; transforming individual objects or groups of selected objects(translating, rotating, scaling); copying, pasting, deleting individual objects or groups of selectedobjects; exporting (modi ed) construction in standard raster (.png, .jpg) andvector formats (.obj); interaction between the displayed construction and its original Stereosdescription (e.g., a name of a point when printing the construction description can be obtained by clicking on the point in the display), enabling user to take bene t of both paradigms a construction language and GUI based constructions; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DesignGUI architectureThe client is implemented using modern web technologies (HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript) and using oftheshelf libraries for 3D visualization (e.g., ThreeJS) and for GUI componets (e.g., DHTMLX, bootstrap CSS). The JavaScript implementation of such a complex GUI client component should follow the well-known objectoriented design patterns. A ModelView- Controller design should enable separation of the core construction representation (represented by a model class) and its different views (e.g., a view in the form of 3D render and view in the form of list of objects should coexist in the same page and refer to the same underlying construction model). Different tools (selection tools, moving tools, viewportmanipulation tools, etc) should be implement within different controller classes. GUI should provide standard components (toolbars for different commands, menus, contextmenus, property dialogs, color choosers, slidebars, etc), and these could be implemented by using thirdparty CSS3 libraries.
